      <h1>About The Agents</h1>
      <div>
        <p>
          The LAO is a global group of Ethereum enthusiasts and experts
          supporting the work of Ethereum builders.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the most promising applications of Ethereum is the
          decentralized (autonomous) organization, also known as a DAO. In 2016,
          the Ethereum community saw the first great experiment with DAOs with
          the launch of "The DAO." The DAO raised over $150 million dollars, but
          it ultimately failed due to legal and technical challenges.
        </p>

        <p>
          The LAO was organized in the spirit of The DAO, as a member-directed
          venture capital fund organized in the United States, with an aim to be
          compliant with U.S. law. Like The DAO, The LAO allows Members to pool
          capital, invest in projects, and share in any proceeds from the
          investment.
        </p>

        <p>
          The LAO is organized as a legal entity (a Delaware limited liability
          company) primarily administered via an online application (a "DApp")
          and related smart contracts.
        </p>

        <p>
          Launched in late April 2020, the LAO has backed over 130 projects
          across the Ethereum and blockchain ecosystem.
