## Overview

### The problem

Users need and should be able to:

- Mint AgentsNFT to have access to the DAO. NFT can be transferred also
  - There whitelist slots for free minting, and its taken into account when calculating total supply of the NFT.
- A smart contract to handle the governing and operations on the DAO
  - Making of proposals to buy an asset
  - Voting in support or against a proposal
  - Keeping track of the validity period for a proposal, then executing or dismissing it after the time elapses
- Deployment of both contracts on an Ethereum test network
- An well designed and responsive frontend to allow interaction with the smart contracts deployed on the blockchain
